Poor first attempt at using web scraping in python. Code works, but its very slow and is very inefficient.

school-list.py -> Print every school and the amount of band sixes they got to an array
script.py -> Find amount of band sixes in a school and the amount of student who got them. Then print the students.

Both output to a .txt file.
